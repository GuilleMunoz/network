# Network

A network (also known as graph) is a mathematical structure made up by a set of points or nodes and a set of edges (links between two nodes).
Euler is regarded as the father of graph theory since he published the first (known) [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_KÃ¶nigsberg) on this field.
Since Euler graph theory has been used to solve a whole host of problems, such as route planning or even to [fight an outbreak of a disease](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2014/09/15/graph-theory-applied-to-disease-transmission/).

This project provides a simple implementation of a graph data structure and multiple algorithms in the blazingly fast C++.

## Usage

We will work with the example "test.cpp" (see also CMakeLists.txt).

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./test
